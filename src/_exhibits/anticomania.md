       <p>The French revolution instituted an era characterized by a greater emphasis on individual rights. This focus on the individual ushered in an explosion of unique, new fashion styles for both men and women. Particularly fashionable, was ‘anticomania’- a reimagining of worldly and antique styles- particularly those of Greek, Roman, and far East origins. In this plate, we see the impact of both the turban style as well as a "Lisbeth corset" so named after Mme. Saint-Aubin, an actress who played the part of Lisbeth in a Favières and Grétry comic opera.</p>
