	<h1>Indian Fabrics</h1>

<p>The fabrics for the most iconic women's clothes of this period came from India. Only in India, was there the technical ability to produce the finest cotton muslins, sometimes called 'mulls.' Cashmere shawls, came from Kashmir; where they were also the product of unrivaled textile techniques.</p>
